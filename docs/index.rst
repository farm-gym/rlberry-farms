Farming with RL agents
======================

rlberry-farms is a collection of Reinforcement-Learning [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environments featuring agricultural games constructed via [farm-gym](https://gitlab.inria.fr/rl4ae/farm-gym). These environments are toy environments and they are not meant to represent exactly the real-life challenges of a farmer but they are meant to illustrate some of the problems that a scientist would encounter when deploying a RL agent in the field.
